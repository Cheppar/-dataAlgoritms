//MATH ALGORITHMS
// - includes basic math algorithms
We will cover
1. Fibonacci sequence
2. Factorial of a number
3. Prime number
4. Power of two
5. Recursion

// - IMPLEMENT
1. Fibonacci sequence with recursion
2. Factorial of a number with recursion

// STEPS: 
1. Problem statement
2. Pause the video and give it a try
3. Implement the solution together.
4. Determione the big O time complexity of the solution.
